Automatically feed articles to Fakebox and store labels back to csv. file.   
Require Python3 to run urllib.  
Run Main.py directly and output.csv will be written.
If it doesn't work on Windows, perhaps it's because you don't have authority for writing files.  
Re-install Python or turn to Linux.  
Supported by Huankang Guan.
